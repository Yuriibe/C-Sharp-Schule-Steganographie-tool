# SteganoSaurus - Steganography Tool ðŸ¦–ðŸ”’

## Overview

SteganoSaurus is a steganography tool designed to hide and extract secret messages within images using various steganographic methods, including the well-known Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. This tool aims to demonstrate how data can be hidden within media files, undetectable to the naked eye.

## Features

- **LSB Encoding & Decoding**: Hide messages inside images by modifying the least significant bits.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface to make hiding and extracting data easy.
- **Multiple Image Format Support**: The tool supports several image formats, including PNG, BMP, and more to come.
- **Error Handling**: Smart error detection to guide users when data cannot be embedded or extracted properly.
- **Future Expansion**: Upcoming support for more steganographic techniques, such as DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).

## Steps:

1. **Choose an image**: Upload an image file to hide your message in.
2. **Enter your message**: Type in the secret message you want to hide.
3. **Encode the message**: SteganoSaurus  will subtly alter the image to embed your hidden data.
4. **Decode a message**: If an image contains hidden data, SteganoSaurus can retrieve and display the secret message.
